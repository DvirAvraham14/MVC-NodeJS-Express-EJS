The MVC-NodeJS-Express-EJS project is a web application that leverages the NASA Astronomy Picture of the Day (APOD) API. The application allows users to scroll through and view photos retrieved from the API based on their date.

Key Features:

User Authentication: The project incorporates a user system where users can register, log in, and log out. Authentication ensures that only logged-in users can access the photos and interact with the application's features.

Photo Search by Date: Users can specify a date and retrieve the corresponding photo from the NASA APOD API. The application fetches the image and displays it along with relevant information about the photo, such as its title, description, and date.

Scroll between Photos: Users have the ability to navigate through the available photos by scrolling forward or backward using pagination. This feature enables users to explore a timeline of captivating astronomical images captured by NASA.

Commenting System: Authenticated users can comment on the displayed photos, sharing their thoughts or engaging in discussions with other users. The comments section allows for a collaborative and interactive experience around the captivating images from the APOD API.

Technology Stack:
The project is built using the following technologies:

Node.js: A JavaScript runtime environment for server-side development.
Express.js: A web application framework for Node.js that simplifies routing, middleware management, and request handling.
EJS (Embedded JavaScript): A template engine that allows embedding JavaScript code within HTML templates.
NASA APOD API: An API provided by NASA that retrieves Astronomy Picture of the Day images.
Overall, the MVC-NodeJS-Express-EJS project combines the power of Node.js, Express.js, and the NASA APOD API to create a user-centric web application where users can explore stunning astronomical images, leave comments, and engage with a community of astronomy enthusiasts.
